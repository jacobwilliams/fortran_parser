Just a short readme to give a few examples.

To compile the test program, I use

	f90 precision.f90 interpreter.f90 test.f90 -o test

Now, the test code only accepts 2 variables 

	  real(fdp), dimension(2) :: t

See the dimension(2) bit... if you want test for more variables, change the 
2 to say 4.

Anyway, once the code is compiled, here is a test run

	./test
	x^2+y
	x y
	3 7.01
	   16.0100000000000

So, the function is entered in, the variables are space seperated and the
numbers are space seperated (entering in a real vector).

The function and variables line are just strings 50 characters long.

Example:

	./test
	(exp(sin(x)**2))^2+sin(cos(sqrt(y+13)))
	x y
	3.1 -2
	  0.170346110690791

I hope this helps.

Stu.
